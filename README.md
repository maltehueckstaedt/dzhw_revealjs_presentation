You can create Revealjs presentations using the revealjs format. The best way to get a sense for the capabilities of Revealjs is this demo presentation:
https://maltehueckstaedt.github.io/dzhw_revealjs_template/

## How to install

The DZHW-[Quarto](https://quarto.org)-Theme can be installed using the following command:

``` bash

```
If you are unable to install Quarto extensions, you probably should [update Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

## How to use it

After you install the template, use the following code on terminal to create a new directory with all files needed:

``` bash
quarto use template maltehueckstaedt/dzhw_revealjs_template
```

```bash
Quarto templates may execute code when documents are rendered. If you do not 
trust the authors of the template, we recommend that you do not install or 
use the template.
```

```bash
